Description
===

TheFragebogen enables you to create _digital questionnaires_.  
A questionnaire is implemented in JavaScript and can be directly executed in a JavaScript-enabled web browser.

The main goal for implementing TheFragebogen was to create a software framework for questionnaires that:

* runs almost everywhere,
* works standalone,
* can be easily extended, and
* can be integrated with other software solutions.

Overview on features
---

* _Simple setup:_ only a JavaScript-enabled web browser is required (HTML5-capability  is a plus).
* _Built-in scales:_ a large number of scales is built-in (e.g., [NASA-TLX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA-TLX)).
* _Skinning:_ CSS can be used to skin a questionnaire as desired.
* _Data export:_ download to the local machine or upload to a web server.
* _Connectivity:_ interact via HTTP or [Websockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) to other systems.

For an introduction, see:
