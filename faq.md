Frequently asked questions
===

What can I do with TheFragebogen?
---

TheFragebogen was developed to easily implement scientific questionnaires using HTML5 and JavaScript.

How can I debug a questionnaire implemented using TheFragebogen?
---

You can either use your favorite web browser development tools, e.g., [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools), [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools), or [Opera](http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/) etc.  
In the standard configuration, TheFragebogen uses  `console.{log, info, error}` (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/Console/log)).

How can I report a bug, request a feature, or submit a patch?
---

For bugs and feature requests, please create an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheFragebogen/thefragebogen/).  
This should include at least:

* a _complete, precise, and understandable_ description of the bug / feature, and
* (for bugs) example code and necessary information (e.g., web browser, version of TheFragebogen) to reproduce your issue.

Before report a bug, please verify that the issue is related with TheFragebogen and _NOT_ with:

* your web browser,
* the HTML5/Javascript/CSS-specs,
* your network connection, or
* your media, e.g., videos.
